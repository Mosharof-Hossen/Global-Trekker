# Project Name : [Go Travel](https://go-travel-12.web.app/)

## Note: For free hosting, the server should be restarted after 30 minutes. So follow the picture below.

## Features: 
1. This is a Travel website.
2. Basically I have implemented CRUD operation on MongoDB database and Firebese Authentication.
3. Tourist spots details can be created, read, updated, deleted.
4. Here some routes are private/protected route.
5. For login/registration I used firebase authentication like email-password, google and github login.
6. I have used validation in login and registration form.
7. Tourist Spot Section: Here I show at least 12 cards of tourist spots, I have added to the database.
8. Add Tourists Spot Page: Created an Add Tourists Spot page where there is a form for the user to add a Tourists Spot. this is a private/protected route.
9. All Tourists Spot page: Created an All Tourists Spot page where we see the tourist spots all the users have added to the database. And here used Sort Functionality based on "average_cost".
10. View Details Page: The Tourists Spot detail route is a private/protected route.
11. My List Page: It is also private/protected route. Here you can delete and update the the tourist spot.
12. In the country section, click on any country card to see all the spots in that country.
13. Both the server site and the client site were challenging. I enjoyed it.
