# Project Name : [Go Travel](https://go-travel-12.web.app/)

## Note: For free hosting, the server should be restarted after 30 minutes. So follow the picture below.

## Features: 
1. This is a Travel website.
2. Basically I have implemented CRUD operation on MongoDB database and Firebese Authentication.
3. Tourist spots details can be created, read, updated, deleted.
4. Here some routes are private/protected route.
5. For login/registration I used firebase authentication like email-password, google and github login.
6. I have used validation in login and registration form.
7. Tourist Spot Section: Here I show at least 12 cards of tourist spots, I have added to the database.
8. Add Tourists Spot Page: Created an Add Tourists Spot page where there is a form for the user to add a Tourists Spot.
9. Both the server site and the client site were challenging. I enjoyed it.
